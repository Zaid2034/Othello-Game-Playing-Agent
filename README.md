Othello Game 
â€“ Implemented an game-playing agent for Othello game using the MiniMax algorithm and k-step look-ahead strategy.
  Implemented an algorithm that evaluates the current board state of game and predicts the next best possible move.
  Developed a decision tree-based approach using alternating Max and Min nodes to model game states and moves.
  Utilized recursion and backtracking techniques to evaluate the possible moves at each depth of the decision tree.
